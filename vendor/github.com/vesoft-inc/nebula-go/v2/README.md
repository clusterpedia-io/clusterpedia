## Install

```shell
$ go get -u -v github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-go@master
```

If you get a message like `cannot use path@version syntax in GOPATH mode`, see the instructions below for [enabling go modules](#enabling-go-modules).

## Usage example

[Simple Code Example](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-go/tree/master/basic_example/graph_client_basic_example.go)

## Enabling go modules

Dependency management tools are built into go 1.11+ in the form of [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
If you are using go 1.11 or 1.12 and are working with a project located within `$GOPATH`, you need to do:

```sh
export GO111MODULE=on
```

Ensure your project has a `go.mod` file defined at the root of your project.
If you do not already have one, `go mod init` will create one for you:

```sh
go mod init
```

And then try to get dependencies of `github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-go` in your go module by simply `go get -u -v github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-go@master`.
